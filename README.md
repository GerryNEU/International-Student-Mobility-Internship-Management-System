# International-Student-Mobility-Internship-Management-System
This project addresses the need for a centralized platform that connects home universities, host universities, companies, and visa agencies in one ecosystem. By standardizing work requests and workflows, we aim to reduce manual coordination effort, increase transparency, and improve the student mobility and internship experience.
